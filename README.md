COVID-19 Data Visualizer is a Python-based data analysis and visualization project designed to track the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic for a specific country. Using powerful libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for plotting, this project reads historical COVID-19 data from a CSV file and generates meaningful visual insights to help users understand how the virus has spread over time.

The project begins by loading the dataset and filtering it based on the selected country (e.g., USA). It then converts the date column into a proper datetime format to enable accurate time-series analysis. Two critical metrics—daily confirmed cases and reported deaths—are extracted and plotted over time on the same graph. The resulting line chart provides a clear comparison between the rise in cases and fatalities, helping to reveal patterns, peaks, and key moments in the country's pandemic timeline.

The final visualization is saved as a PNG image (covid_trend.png) and can be used for presentations, reports, or further data analysis. This project is ideal for learners, analysts, or researchers interested in understanding real-world data through visualization, and it can be easily extended to support multiple countries, additional metrics (like recoveries or vaccinations), or even real-time data sources via APIs.
